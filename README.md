# Adopt a Pet React Router
## Codecademy Course Project

This is a page for a fake pet adoption center - it has pets listed by category, you can search for pets, and the site fetches internal JSON data for some pets. 

### Languages

React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, JSX

### Project Highlights

This project was designed to introduce students to React Router - my job was to link up all of the pages, so I was working mostly in the App.js. I used NavLinks, Links, Routes, useParams for dynamic paths, and Redirects. Dynamic paths and the useParams hook gave me the most pause, as this was my first time working with them. However it all worked smoothly by the end.
